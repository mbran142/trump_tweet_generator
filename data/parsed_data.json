    "They are sending out 51,000,000 Ballots to people who haven't even requested a Ballot. Many of those people don't even exist. They are trying to STEAL this election. This should not be allowed!",
    "Does anyone notice that the real Polls, as opposed to the Fake Suppression Polls also used in 2016, are starting to define Sleepy Joe Biden as someone totally I'll-equipped to control the Radical Left, Crime, Cancel Culture, or to even come close to me on REBUILDING THE ECONOMY?",
    "Russian Billionaire wired Hunter Biden 3 1/2 Million Dollars. This on top of all of the other money he received while Joe was V.P. Crooked as can be, but Fake Mainstream Media wants it to just go away!",
    "2016? HERE WE GO AGAIN!",
    "....Example! V.P. Mike Pence held a conference call yesterday with all Democrat Senators. He gave them everything that they would have wanted to hear in terms of gaining ground on the CoronaVirus, but nothing that anyone could have said, including \"it's over\", could have made....",
    "No matter what you do for the Do Nothing Democrats, no matter how GREAT a job you are doing, they will only respond to their Fake partners in the Lamestream Media in the negative, even in a time of crisis. I thought it would be different, but it's not. In fact, it's even worse...",
    "To get into the Democrat National Convention, you must have an ID card with a picture...Yet the Democrats refuse to do this when it come to your very important VOTE! Gee, I wonder WHY???",
    "....them happy, or even a little bit satisfied. They were RUDE and NASTY. This is their political playbook, and they will use it right up to the election on November 3rd. They will not change because they feel that this is the only way they can win. America will not be fooled!!!",
    "Does anyone notice that the real Polls, as opposed to the Fake Suppression Polls also used in 2016, are starting to define Sleepy Joe Biden as someone totally ill-equipped to control the Radical Left, Crime, Cancel Culture, or to even come close to me on REBUILDING THE ECONOMY?",
    "96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. 51% Approval Rating overal in the Rasmussen Poll. Thank you!",
    "The most often used phrase in the Lamestream Media, by far, is \"sources say\", or \"officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity\", or anything similar which allows Fake News to make up a phony quote from a person who doesn't even exist. The American people should demand NAMES!",
    "Do RINO'S Pat Toomey & Mitt Romney have any problem with the fact that we caught Obama, Biden, & Company illegally spying on my campaign? Do they care if Comey, McCabe, Page & her lover, Peter S, the whole group, ran rampant, wild & unchecked - lying & leaking all the way? NO!",
    "After the worst debate performance in the history of politics, Michael Bloomberg, commonly known as Mini Mike, is trying to make a comeback by begging the Democrats for relevance. They treated him like a dog - and always will. Before politics, he said GREAT things about me!",
    "Governors Andrew Cuomo of New York has the worst record on death and China Virus. 11,000 people alone died in Nursing Homes because of his incompetence!",
    "Are you better off now than you were three years ago? Almost everyone say YES!",
    "96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. 51% Approval Rating overall in the Rasmussen Poll. Thank you!",
    "The Fed should get smart &  lower the Rate to make our interest competitive with other Countries which pay much lower even though we are, by far, the high standard. We would then focus on paying off & refinancing debt! There is almost no inflation-this is the time (2 years late)!",
    "Up BIG in South Carolina!",
    "....after you Vote, which it should not, that Ballot will not be used or counted in that your vote has already been cast & tabulated. YOU ARE NOW ASSURED THAT YOUR PRECIOUS VOTE HAS BEEN COUNTED, it hasn't been \"lost, thrown out, or in any way destroyed\". GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!",

    "Based on the massive number of Unsolicited & Solicited Ballots that will be sent to potential Voters for the upcoming 2020 Election, & in order for you to MAKE SURE YOUR VOTE COUNTS & IS COUNTED, SIGN & MAIL IN your Ballot as EARLY as possible. On Election Day, or Early Voting,..",
    "The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!",
    "In 47 years, Joe did none of the things of which he now speaks. He will never change, just words!",
    "We have now built 240 Miles of new Border Wall on our Southern Border. We will have over 450 Miles built by the end of the year. Have established some of the best Border Numbers ever. The Radical Left Democrats want Open Borders for anyone, including many criminals, to come in!",
    "We've done a GREAT job on Covid response, making all Governors look good, some fantastic (and that's OK), but the Lamestream Media doesn't want to go with that narrative, and the Do Nothing Dems talking point is to say only bad about \"Trump\". I made everybody look good, but me!",
    "I know many in business and politics that work out endlessly, in some cases to a point of exhaustion. It is their number one passion in life, but nobody complains. My \"exercise\" is playing, almost never during the week, a quick round of golf. Obama played more and much longer....",
    "...rounds, no problem. When I play, Fake News CNN, and others, park themselves anywhere they can to get a picture, then scream \"President Trump is playing golf.\" Actually, I play VERY fast, get a lot of work done on the golf course, and also get a \"tiny\" bit of exercise. Not bad!",
    "Crazy Nancy Pelosi said she was \"set up\" by the beauty parlor owner when she improperly had the salon opened (and didn't wear a MASK!). Does anyone want a Speaker of the House who can be so easily SET UP?",
    "Senator Little Ben Sasse of the Great State of Nebraska seems to be heading down the same inglorious path as former Senators Liddle' Bob Corker, whose approval rating in Tennessee went from 55% to 4%, & Jeff \"the Flake\" Flake, whose approval rating in Arizona went from 56% to....",
    "Nancy Pelosi says she got \"set up\" by a Beauty Parlor owner. Maybe the Beauty Parlor owner should be running the House of Representatives instead of Crazy Nancy?",
    "Hearing that Iran is looking to execute a great and popular wrestling star, 27-year-old Navid Afkarai, whose sole act was an anti-government demonstration on the streets. They were protesting the \"country's worsening economic situation and inflation\"...",
    "No, Radical Left anarchists, agitators, looters or protesters will not be knocking down or harming the Washington Monument, the Lincoln or Jefferson Memorials, or just about any other Federal Monumrnt or Statue. If they even try, an automatic 10 years in prison. Sorry!",
    "Robert, I Love You. Rest In Peace!",
    "Another bad night of Rioting in Portland, Oregon. A small number of Federal troops there to protect courthouse and other Federal property only (great job!). Wanting to be asked by City & State to STOP THE RIOTS. Would bring in National Guard, end problem immediately. ASK!",
    "Cheating on Unsolicited Ballots by political hacks, or anyone else, is against the law. We are closely watching!",
    "Heading to New Jersey. Big Rally, in fact, Really Big Rally!",
    "The Democrats took the word GOD out of the Pledge of Allegiance at the Democrat National Convention. At first I thought they made a mistake, but it wasn't. It was done on purpose. Remember Evangelical Christians, and ALL, this is where they are coming from-it's done. Vote Nov 3!",
    "Joe Hiden' get off his airplane, grabs and shakes a rather stunned man's hand (like in the old days), then touches his (Joe's) face and mask with the same hand. No crowd, no enthusiasm for Joe today. Law & Order!",
    "Great new book just out, \"Taken for Granted, How Conservatives Can Win Back Americans That Liberalism Failed\", by Gianni Caldwell, a young winner! He will be at the Ronald Reagan Library, Simi Valley, California, on Thursday at 6 PM, PT. Check it out!",
    "It's amazing what I've done, the most of any President in the first three years (by far), considering that for three years I've been under phony political investigations and the Impeachment Hoax! KEEP AMERICA GREAT!",
    "Biden and the Democrats have greatly disrespected the Great State of Wisconsin by not even paying a small visit to Milwaukee, the designated site of the DNC. The State & City worked very hard to make sure things would be good. Not nice. Vote Trump Wisconsin!",
    "Why would Suburban Women vote for Biden and the Democrats when Democrat run cities are now rampant with crime (and they aren't asking the Federal Government for help) which could easily spread to the suburbs, and they will reconstitute, on steroids, their low income suburbs plan!",
    "This is not about the ridiculous Green New Deal. It is about putting our great workers and companies BACK TO WORK!",
    "The United States shows more CASES than other countries, which the Lamestream Fake News Media pounces on daily, because it TESTS at such a high (and costly) level. No country in the world tests at this level. The more you TEST, the more CASES you will be reporting. Very simple!",
    "Joe Hiden' gets off his airplane, grabs and shakes a rather stunned man's hand (like in the old days), then touches his (Joe's) face and mask with the same hand. No crowd, no enthusiasm for Joe today. Law & Order!",
    "The Defense Production Act is in full force, but haven't had to use it because no one has said NO! Millions of masks coming as back up to States.",
    "....on all Trump, or Trump related, matters! While \"elections have consequences\", I only ask for fairness, especially when it comes to decisions made by the United States Supreme Court!",
    "Hunter Biden's laptop is a disaster for the entire Biden family, but especially for his father, Joe. It is now a proven fact, and cannot be denied, that all of that info is the REAL DEAL. That makes it impossible for \"50%, or 10%\" Joe, to ever assume the office of the President!",
    "Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today. The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy. Our workers will be hurt!",
    "Joe Biden is a corrupt politician, and everybody knows it. Now you have the proof, perhaps like never was had before on a major politician. Laptop plus. This is the second biggest political scandal in our history!",
    "Our people want to return to work. They will practice Social Distancing and all else, and Seniors will be watched over protectively & lovingly. We can do two things together. THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM! Congress MUST ACT NOW. We will come back strong!",
    "In New Jersey they want you to certify that you asked for the Universal Mail-In Ballot that they sent you. But you never asked for it. Disaster in the wings!",
    "Congratulations to Randy Feenstra on your big win in the Iowa Republican Primary. You will be a great Congressman!",
    "Never in history have Police been treated so badly as they are in Democrat run cities - and these cities are a mess. Police must take a stronger stand with the Radical Left politicians that are treating them so badly, and so disrespectfully!!!",
    "Cryin' Chuck Schumer is complaining, for publicity purposes only, that I should be asking for more money than $2.5 Billion to prepare for Coronavirus. If I asked for more he would say it is too much. He didn't like my early travel closings. I was right. He is incompetent!",
    "LAW & ORDER!",
    "Price transparency is so important for the people of our Country. In many ways, it will prove to be as important as healthcare itself. A great issue for both Republicans and Democrats. Hopefully it will be approved!",
    "Just like I was right on Ventilators (our Country is now the \"King of Ventilators\", other countries are calling asking for help-we will!), I am right on testing. Governors must be able to step up and get the job done. We will be with you ALL THE WAY!",
    "Representatives of the Post Office have repeatedly stated that they DO NOT NEED MONEY, and will not make changes. This is all another HOAX by the Democrats to give 25 Billion unneeded dollars for political purposes,  without talking about the Universal Mail-In Ballot Scam....",
    "Corrupt politician Joe Biden makes Crooked Hillary look like an amateur!",
    "....that they are trying to pull off in violation of everything that our Country stands for. Vote NO to the Pelosi/ Schumer money wasting HOAX which is taking place now. Then fight the $51 million unasked for Ballots. Only ABSENTEE BALLOTS are acceptable!",
    "There has rarely been a juror so tainted as the forewoman in the Roger Stone case. Look at her background. She never revealed her hatred of \"Trump\" and Stone. She was totally biased, as is the judge. Roger wasn't even working on my campaign. Miscarriage of justice. Sad to watch!",
    "No matter how many witnesses you give the Democrats, no matter how much information is given, like the quickly produced Transcripts, it will NEVER be enough for them. They will always scream UNFAIR. The Impeachment Hoax is just another political CON JOB!",
    "The Silent Majority will reign!",
    "In 3 1/2 years, I've done much more for our Black population than Joe Biden has done in 43 years. Actually, he set them back big time with his Crime Bill, which he doesn't even remember. I've done more for Black Americans, in fact, than any President in U.S. history, with...",

    "....the possible exception of another Republican President, the late, great, Abraham Lincoln...and it's not even close. The Democrats know this, and so does the Fake News, but they refuse to write or say it because they are inherently corrupt! See \"pinned\" above.",

    "The Democrats could solve the Shutdown problem in a very short period of time. All they have to do is approve REAL Border Security (including a Wall), something which everyone, other than drug dealers, human traffickers and criminals, want very badly! This would be so easy to do!",
    "Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border. Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!",
    "Thank you to Kanye West for your nice words. Criminal Justice Reform is now law - passed in a very bipartisan way!",
    "The story in the New York Times regarding Jim Webb being considered as the next Secretary of Defense is FAKE NEWS. I'm sure he is a fine man, but I don't know Jim, and never met him. Patrick Shanahan, who is Acting Secretary of Defense, is doing a great job!",
    "GREAT JOBS NUMBERS JUST ANNOUNCED!",
    "How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time, done nothing wrong (no Collusion with Russia, it was the Dems that Colluded), had the most successful first two years of any president, and is the most popular Republican in party history 93%?",
    "As I have stated many times, if the Democrats take over the House or Senate, there will be disruption to the Financial Markets. We won the Senate, they won the House. Things will settle down. They only want to impeach me because they know they can't win in 2020, too much success!",
    "....President Trump deserves a lot of credit, but again, you have the anti-Trump people who are not going to give him a lot of credit.\"",
    "The United States Treasury has taken in MANY billions of dollars from the Tariffs we are charging China and other countries that have not treated us fairly. In the meantime we are doing well in various Trade Negotiations currently going on. At some point this had to be done!",
    "The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election. The Democrats know they can't win based on all of the achievements of \"Trump,\" so they are going all out on the desperately needed Wall and Border Security - and Presidential Harassment. For them, strictly politics!",
    "Sadly, there can be no REAL Border Security without the Wall!",
    "...I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let's get it done!",
    "Important meeting today on Border Security with Republican and Democrat Leaders in Congress. Both parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people - this is the first and most important duty of government...",
    "Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that House has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security. Quick payback!",
    "Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake?  I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn't. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!",
    "For FAR TOO LONG Senate Democrats have been Obstructing more than 350 Nominations. These great Americans left their jobs to serve our Country, but can't because Dems are blocking them, some for two years-historic record. Passed committees, but Schumer putting them on hold. Bad!",
    "Do you think it's just luck that gas prices are so low, and falling? Low gas prices are like another Tax Cut!",
    "\"Kim Jong Un says North Korea will not make or test nuclear weapons, or give them to others - & he is ready to meet President Trump anytime.\" PBS News Hour. I also look forward to meeting with Chairman Kim who realizes so well that North Korea possesses great economic potential!",
    "Washington Examiner - \"MAGA list: 205 'historic results' help Trump make case for 2020 re-election.\"  True!",
    "Gas prices are low and expected to go down this year. This would be good!",
    "Border Security and the Wall \"thing\" and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let's make a deal?",
    "One thing has now been proven. The Democrats do not care about Open Borders and all of the crime and drugs that Open Borders bring!",
    "The Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security - and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border!",
    "Happy New Year!",
    "HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE, INCLUDING THE HATERS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA! 2019 WILL BE A FANTASTIC YEAR FOR THOSE NOT SUFFERING FROM TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME. JUST CALM DOWN AND ENJOY THE RIDE, GREAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING FOR OUR COUNTRY!",
    "Dr. Sebastian Gorka, a very good and talented guy, has a great new book just out, \"Why We Fight.\" Lots of insight - Enjoy!",
    "...Remember this. Throughout the ages some things NEVER get better and NEVER change. You have Walls and you have Wheels. It was ALWAYS that way and it will ALWAYS be that way! Please explain to the Democrats that there can NEVER be a replacement for a good old fashioned WALL!",
    "The Democrats will probably submit a Bill, being cute as always, which gives everything away but gives NOTHING to Border Security, namely the Wall. You see, without the Wall there can be no Border Security - the Tech \"stuff\" is just, by comparison, meaningless bells & whistles...",
    "MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL through the many billions of dollars a year that the U.S.A. is saving through the new Trade Deal, the USMCA, that will replace the horrendous NAFTA Trade Deal, which has so badly hurt our Country. Mexico & Canada will also thrive - good for all!",
